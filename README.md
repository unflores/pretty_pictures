Pretty Pictures
===============

Here is a cute script I made for Mr. Cupples.  Make a accounts.yml file.

If you want to take snapshots of all of the volumes of one account just call:

		pretty_pictures [account_key]

Otherwise call

		pretty_pictures

to take snapshots of all of the volumes for all of the accounts in the accounts.yml
